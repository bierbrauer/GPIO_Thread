GPIO_Thread is a collection of different projects that subclass the pulsedThread class to control GPIO hardware on the Raspberry Pi.  SimpleGPIO_thread is a C++ class for threaded Pulses and Trains of Pulses. The relevant files are:

SimpleGPIO_thread.cpp/h	- C++ class for a thread to do a pulse or a train of pulses on a GPIO pin
SimpleGPIO_tester.cpp	- C++ application using SimpleGPIO_thread to do software pulse width modulation
SimpleGPIO_Py.cpp	- C++ code for a Python module to make and use a SimpleGPIO_thread from Python
SimpleGPIO_setup.py	- Python code to make and install the ptSimpleGPIO Python library
PTSimpleGPIO.py	- Python code that wraps the ptSimpleGPIO module in a Python object interface
PTSimpleGPIO_test.py	- Python code with tests for PTSimpleGPIO. May require oscilloscope, LED, or piezo
int pin, int polarity, unsigned int delayUsecs, unsigned int durUsecs, unsigned int nPulses, int accuracyLevel
For each project, XX there is:
<ul>
	<li>XX.cpp/XX.h pair describing a C++ class that subclasses pulsedThread</li>
	<li>XX_tester.cpp, or XX_runner.cpp, that makes a small stand-alone application for testing purposes</li>
	<li>XX_Py.cpp file that describes a Python/C module that wraps the C++ class methods with Python calls</li>
	<li>XX_setup.py that builds and installs the Python/C module</li>
	<li>often, XX.py that provides a "Pythonic" object interface to the Python/C module</li>
</ul>

/* The 3 parts to running the lever pulling task  
1) The program calling the leverThread object 
	- may be in Python through a Python C++ module that provides an interface to a leverThread object
	- makes an array of unsigned bytes to hold lever position data
	- makes the leverThread object, passing it a pointer to the lever position data, plus some size info
	- sets constant force, sets lever hold params, sets force params if doing force
	-starts a trial 
	- checks a trial to see if it is done. For an uncued trial, this could be while. 
	- is responsible for saving the lever position data in the array before starting another trial
	
2) the leverThread object
	- makes a leverThread struct 
	- receives data from calling program
	- writes to leverThreadStruct shared with the thread function to signal thread
	- makes the array for leverForce data and passes a pointer to that data to the leverThread struct
	
3) the threaded function that works with leverThreadStruct
	- timing controlled by pulsedThread superclass. Can be Trian or Infinite train with circular buffer
	- does the hardware stuff, reading the encoder and outputting force
