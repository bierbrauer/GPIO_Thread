# GPIO Thread
GPIO Thread contains a collection of C++ classes that subclass the pulsedThread library, https://github.com/jamieboyd/pulsedThread, providing precise, independent timing of events using the GPIO pins of the Raspberry Pi.  This includes pulses or trains of pulses, as well as special functions such as control of the PWM peripheral. GPIO Thread also contains Python C-modules that control the GPIO pins using a pulsedThread subclass object wrapped in a PyCapsule.
